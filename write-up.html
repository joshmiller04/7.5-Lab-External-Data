        <p> 
            Using Copilot during this lab was in some ways extremely effective however in other ways it was extremely ineffective. Once I implemented most of the alpine.js code and pushed it to run it wouldn't. So I started to ask Copilotwhat. I started by asking simple questions to try to figure out why I was receiving errors and overall the counter was not working. At the beginning Copilot was giving me a lot of information and code that did not work when I implemented it. I continued to ask questions relating to my issues and once CoPilot got a better understanding of what I needed it was helpful. Although often when asking CoPilot questions and when it would give me code that did not work it was very frustrating to keep tyring code it would give me but was not what I wanted.

            Overall, using both models allowed me  compare diferant ways its better or worse
