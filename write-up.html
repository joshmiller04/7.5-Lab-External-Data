            Using an AI co-pilot to help me throughout this lab was not very helpful at all to me. I found it very hard to understand the information and code that it was giving back to me and I also found it didn't do a great job of implementing everything I asked it to. Some of the prompts I would ask were pretty simple, asking if it could  figure out why Alpine JS wasn't running and also giving it prompts of how I can effectively put the Tailwind script Link in my HTML. simple things did seem pretty easy however once I started getting lots of errors and code that wasn't working it became much more difficult.


        <p class="mb-4">
            I think AI is a great tool, however there is still a lot of room to improve in order to make this actually useful and not cause more stress. Overall I found myself caught up and everything the co-pilot was doing and found myself in a deep hole.  When I tried to even start over numerous times I still found myself getting stuck at the same spots. Perhaps for someone who is a more experienced developer they could have troubleshooting this more and found out why and what is causing it not to work.
