            Using Copilot during this lab was in some ways extremely effective however in other ways it was extremely ineffective. Once I implemented most of the alpine.js code and pushed it to run it wouldn't. So I started to ask Copilot simple questions to try to figure out why I was receiving errors and overall the counter was not working. At the beginning Copilot was giving me a lot of information and code that did not work when I implemented it. I continued to ask questions relating to my issues and once CoPilot got a better understanding of what I needed it was helpful. Although often when asking CoPilot questions and when it would give me code that did not work it was very frustrating to keep tyring code it would give me but was not what I wanted.

            Overall I have mixed feelings about using ai. It can be helpful but only after it learns about your site and what exactly you want it to do. But for someone who does not have much experience with it or coding in general it can be very confusing to understand everything its doing exactly even if it is working.
